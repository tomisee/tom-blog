## Cryptography and Number sets
The cryptohunt we ran today had 10 challenges, all of which involved some sort of encryption or cryptography (even basic or ancient forms).

The challenges are as follows:
1. A1Z26 - The participants needed to work out the number values of letters of the alphabet to spell the location for the first token.

2. A simple grid with the location spelt in a reverse spiral

3. Caesar wheels using a one-time pad

4. Scytale encryption using tools inspired by ancient scytale tools

5. Shift ciphers using the caesar wheels from before, this was the same for challenge 6 and 7 also

8. Binary puzzles

9. Hexadecimal puzzles

10. Final challenge was putting the previously collected tokens into decimal, adding them up, and breaking into a prize box.

The prizes for this challenge were a set of sunglasses and USBs (All branded of course ;) )


## Review

With some more practice and a bit longer to carry it out, I think this could be a good introduction for the younger audience (Y10-13) to consider university level challenges and push them to learn more.
