# Why a blog?
I needed a place to put stuff


## What stuff?
Well anything I thought of..... like my plans for this blog for example!


### Who are you?

Well it would be there if I could do it, guess that starts my todo list!

#### Todo:
1. Put image on first post - DONE
2. Create more posts
3. Practice MD and style
4. Get good



## Top three Star Wars movies and why

| Position | Movie | Why? |
| --------- | :---------: | -----------------|
| 1 | Episode IV | It simply is |
| 2 | Episode III | Actually a good story of tragedy | 
| 3 | Episode II | The fight on Geonosis and Count Dooku |
